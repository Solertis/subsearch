The application flow is as follows:

- Initialise
- Parse Arguments
    - Checks if the files provided are real
- Prints welcome text
- Get's the authoritative name server(s) and checks to see if any of them can do zone transfers
    - If it can, does this first
- Begins subdomain bruteforce using Akka Actors
    - SubdomainScanner: This is the master (not an actor) that launches all other actors.
    - Listener: Deals with all output to CLI
    - Dispatcher: Creates all scanners and delegates work to each. Maintains a queue of subdomains, priority subdomains, and resolvers.
    - Scanner: This does the actual lookup.
