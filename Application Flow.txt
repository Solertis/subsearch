The application flow is as follows:

- Initialise
- Parse Arguments
    - Checks if the files provided are real
- Prints welcome text
- Get's the authoritative name server(s) and checks to see if any of them can do zone transfers
    - If it can, does this first
- Create Actors
    - LoggingActor: Deals with all output including CLI and to file
    - ResolverActor: Maintain a queue of valid resolvers
    - SubdomainsActor: Maintain two queues, one with subdomains to search for, and one with priority subdomains to search for
    - SearchCoordinatorActor: Coordinates searches. Maintains a list of "threads". If a SearchActor returns without having done any work,
                              it will decrease the process count until hitting 0, at which point it will terminate the application
    - SearchActor: This does the actual lookup. It gets a subdomain from the SubdomainsActor, and two resolvers from the ResolversActor.
                   When it completes, it recycles the resolvers back to the ResolversActor, tells the LoggingActor about the discovered subdomain,
                   and tells the parent actor that it's done working, finally terminating.
